I am an engineer at Mastercard who loves learning about .NET and API design. Though I am an excellent Duck Duck Go-er, there are some topics that just don't seem to have documenation / blog posts yet. I'm starting to write those blog posts that I wish already existed.

In my freetime, I love reading about city design, walking around my city, serving on the Arlington County pedestrian advisory committee (we advise the county, not pedestians!), playing board games, and volunteering at my church.

P.S. I am looking to speak at conferences / meet-ups. Please reach out if you're interested in having me!
