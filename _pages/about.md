title: "Hi. I'm Lizzy."

By day, I am a software engineer at Mastercard. I enjoy reading tech blogs, so thought I would start one to write the blog posts I look for but can't seem to find.

In my freetime, I love reading about city design, walking around my city, reading about the newly awarded building permits, and sitting on my county's pedestrian advisory committee. Although less on brand, I also enjoy board games and volunteering at my church.

P.S. In addition to blogging, I am looking to speak at meet-ups and tech conferences. If you come across this blog and think I would be a good fit, please reach out!
