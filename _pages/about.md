I am a Senior Software Development Engineer at Mastercard. I started this blog to "fill the gaps" of the blogosphere: writing posts that would have saved me a lot of time if they had existed when I ran into the problem myself!

Favorite posts:
- [An illustrated guide to Autofac](/illustrated-autofac). This post was a **labor** of love. I've used Autofac for years but never had a great conceptual model for how it worked. This post was me working through how to think about thinking about Autofac.
- [Using underdocumentated features](/using-underdocumented-features). As a frequent user of underdocumented features, this post is my attempt at setting a reader up for success in what can sometimes be a frustrating situation.
- [Learn MSBuild](/learn-msbuild-part-1). This 4-part series was another post trying to give the reader a conceptual model for MSBuild (which I <3).

Public speaking:
- [2 years, 200 applications: A .NET Core Migration at Enterprise Scale](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-2haqb60No) (.NET Conf | November 2020)


In my free time, I love reading about city design, walking around Arlington, looking at new building permits, and participating in local government. I also enjoy reading about history and volunteering at church.

P.S. I am looking to speak at more meet-ups and conferences in the future. Please feel free to reach out via Twitter direct message, if you think I would be a good fit for your event.
