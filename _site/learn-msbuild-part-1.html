<p>You can get pretty far as a .NET developer without understanding MSBuild. Sure, very few months you may need to frantically copy/paste a line of MSBuild from StackOverflow into a .csproj, but you can mostly live in blissful ignorance.</p>
<p>As some who has had the (mis?)fortune of spending a lot of time writing MSBuild,  I wanted to put together a resource to empower others to understand it.</p>
<h3 id="why-learn-msbuild">Why learn MSBuild?</h3>
<h4 id="msbuild-is-a-useful-tool-for-your-toolbox">1. MSBuild is a useful tool for your toolbox</h4>
<p><strong>Does your application have a multi-step README for how to build the project?</strong> Using MSBuild, you can smush all those steps together -- restoring npm packages, running webpack, transpiling TypeScript -- into a single <code>dotnet build</code> command.</p>
<p><strong>Does your organization need validation done in every application?</strong> Using MSBuild, you can easily implement validations that can break the build if not satisfied. An ASP.NET project missing a <code>.ConfigureAwait(false)</code>? Fail the build!</p>
<p><strong>Want to the &quot;go-to expert&quot; at your organization in something?</strong> Pick MSBuild. You'll be able to help .NET developers in their darkest days.</p>
<h4 id="msbuild-inspires-fear-due-to-unfamiliarity">2. MSBuild inspires fear due to unfamiliarity</h4>
<p>I have seen the eyes of many excellent engineers glaze over when opening an MSBuild file. Hours sunk into throwing copy/pasted statements against the wall to see if anything sticks.</p>
<h3 id="how-will-this-blog-series-teach-me-msbuild">How will this blog series teach me MSBuild?</h3>
<p>It's easiest to learn new idea by connecting them to old ones, so this series is going to teach MSBuild by explaining it as a programming language.</p>
<p>This series contains 3 posts:</p>
