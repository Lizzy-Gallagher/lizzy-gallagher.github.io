	<p>
		I started this blog to "fill the gaps" of the blogosphere: writing posts that would have saved me a lot of time if they had existed when I ran into the problem myself!
	</p>
	<p>
		In my free time, I love reading about city design, walking around Arlington, looking at new building permits, and participating in local government. I also enjoy reading about history and hanging out with my kids.
